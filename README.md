## ❤️ A Note from the Creator

> I'm from Kericho, born and raised. I've seen firsthand how smallholder tea farmers struggle with price uncertainty. ChaiBora is my way of helping—by bringing the power of data and digital tools back to the grassroots.

---

## 🧩 Problem & Solution Summary

### 📍 Problem

Small-scale tea farmers in Kenya often operate without clear, timely access to pricing data from major buyers. This makes it hard to know when and where to sell their tea for maximum return.

### 💡 Solution

ChaiBora solves this by delivering real-time tea prices, trend insights, and buyer comparisons—all accessible from a mobile-friendly web app. Farmers can even set price alerts to stay ahead.
